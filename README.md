# Gesture App

This app was an attempt to implement a Baseball Scorecard APP which allows the user
to enter baseball plays in a natural way similar to how one would write plays on a
physical scorecard.  A baseball diamond is shown on the face of the phone, and the
user can score a play by drawing a K for a strikeout, a L for line out, F for a
flyout, FC for fielder's choice etc.  The user can also tap bases to indicate
a location.  So a pop-up to the 2nd baseman can be recorded by drawing an F with the
finger, then tapping 2nd base.

Hits are recorded by tracing the finger along the base paths. A single would be
scored by dragging the finger from home plate to first base.

All of the effort went into implementing the Gesture Recognizers.  The app was never
developed into a full-fledged baseball scorecard app.  Other scorecard apps already
existed in the app store which have sophisticated team and player management features,
tracking player stats over the course of a season.

However, I felt like the Interface for entering plays in this app was superior to
any of the other existing commercial baseball scorecard iPhone apps.
